# Interior point methods

Throughout this chapter we will let $f$ denote a twice differentiable function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$. 


## Gradient descent

We will start by trying to solve the following unconstrained optimization problem:
\begin{align}
  \mbox{minimize: } & f(x)
\end{align}
where $x$ is any vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
**Gradient descent** is a simple algorithm for solving this problem using basic differential calculus. 
Gradient descent relies on the fact that *the negative of the gradient points in the direction in which the function decreases the fastest*. 
So the general principle is to move in the direction of the negative gradient until the function is no longer decreasing.

More precisely,

- Let $k = 0$.
- Start with a guess $x_0$ for the optimal solution.
- While minima is not reached: 

    - Set $x_{k+1} = x_k - t_k \nabla f(x_k)$.
    - Increase $k$ to $k+1$.

Here $t_k$ is the "step size" for the $k^{th}$ iteration and can be chosen to be a small constant or some function of $k$, $x_k$, $f(x_k)$, or $\nabla f(x_k)$.

There are several issues with the above algorithm:

1. If the function has multiple local minima, then the algorithm might converge to a non-absolute minima depending on the starting guess and the choice of step sizes.
2. If the step sizes are chosen to be too large, then the algorithm completely miss the minima and may not converge.
3. If the step sizes are chosen to be too small, then the algorithm may take a long time to converge.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to resolve these issues. In practice, either we need to be able to control the function and its gradient or we proceed by trial and error to find step sizes that work. Even then there is no guarantee that the algorithm will converge to an absolute minima and not a local minima, if at all. In spite of these issues, because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and good convergence properties tin practice, Gradient Descent is a very popular algorithm for solving unconstrained optimization problems.
